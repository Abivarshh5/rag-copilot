    "body": "Newton's laws of motion are three basic laws that define the relationship between the motion of an object and the forces acting on it. First Law (Law of Inertia): An object at rest remains at rest, and an object in motion remains in motion at constant speed and in a straight line unless acted on by an unbalanced force. Second Law (Law of Force and Acceleration): The force acting on an object is equal to the mass of that object times its acceleration. F = ma. Third Law (Law of Action and Reaction): For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction."
